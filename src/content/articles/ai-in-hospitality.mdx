We've all been there. You type *"What time is check-in?"* and the bot replies *"I didn't understand that."*

Old-school chatbots were rules-based trees. They were glorified FAQs.
**AI Agents** are different.

## Context Awareness

An AI Agent knows that if a guest asks *"Is the pool warm?"* at 8 PM in December, they are probably cold and looking for reassurance.
It answers: *"Yes! Our pool is heated to 29°C all year round. Would you like me to book you a slot for tomorrow morning?"*

## The Sales Focus

Chatbots deflect support tickets. AI Agents drive revenue.
They recognize intent.
*   Guest: *"Do you have availability next week?"*
*   AI Agent: *"We have 1 Luxury Lodge left for those dates. It usually sells out by Friday. Shall I hold it for you?"*

## Implementation

You don't need a PhD in code. Tools like Voiceflow and OpenAI APIs make it possible to deploy an agent in a weekend.
We stick them on every client site we build. The result? **24/7 sales coverage without the staff cost.**

Welcome to the future.
