For the last decade, Booking.com and Expedia have been the undisputed kings of travel. But things are changing.

## The "Service Fee" Fatigue

In 2025, we saw a massive backlash against hidden service fees. Guests are realizing that booking direct often saves them 10-15%.

## Brand Loyalty Returns

The post-pandemic traveler values connection. They want to know *who* they are staying with. They want to DM you on Instagram and get a real reply, not a generic OTA message.

## What This Means for You

It means your website is no longer just a "nice to have." It is your battleground.
If you can offer a seamless, trust-rich booking experience, you can bypass the middleman entirely.

The OTA era isn't over, but the monopoly is breaking. Are you ready to catch the direct traffic?
