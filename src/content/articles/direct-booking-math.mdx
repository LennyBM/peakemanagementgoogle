We love OTAs (Online Travel Agencies) like Booking.com and Airbnb. They are fantastic for filling gaps.
But if they are your *primary* source of bookings, you are bleeding profit.

## The 15% Tax

Let's do the math on a typical £1,000 booking.

*   **OTA Booking:** You pay £150 commission. You keep **£850**.
*   **Direct Booking:** You pay ~£20 in card fees + marketing cost. You keep **£980**.

That £130 difference doesn't look like much on one booking.
But on £500,000 turnover? **That is £65,000 a year you are giving away.**

That's a salary. That's a new lodge. That's pure profit.

## Why Guests Use OTAs (And How to Steal Them Back)

Guests use OTAs because:
1.  **Trust:** They know their money is safe.
2.  **Ease:** It takes 2 clicks.
3.  **Comparison:** They can see options.

To win direct bookings, you must match this experience:

*   **Offer a "Direct Booking Guarantee":** Promise the lowest price.
*   **Add Incentives:** "Free Early Check-In" for direct bookers cost you nothing but is worth £20-£50 to the guest.
*   **Make Your Site FASTER:** If your site is slower than Airbnb, you lose.

## The "Billboard Effect"

Use OTAs as a billboard. Let people find you there.
But make sure when they Google your park name to check reviews, they find **your** website, and **your** offer is better.

Don't bite the hand that feeds you, but don't let it eat your whole dinner.
