It's a harsh truth, but most holiday park websites are designed to look pretty, not to **perform**.

They have nice drone shots and lists of amenities, but they fail at the one job that matters: **convincing a browsing stranger to pull out their credit card.**

At Peake Management, we've audited over 50+ park websites this year. The pattern is always the same.

## 1. The "Brochure" Trap

Most owners treat their website like a digital version of their printed brochure. It lists facts:
*   "We have 3 caravans."
*   "We are near the beach."
*   "Here is our phone number."

This is information, but it isn't **persuasion**.

A high-performance website takes the user on a journey. It answers the emotional question: *"What will my life feel like when I am there?"* AND the logistical question: *"Is this easy to book?"*

## 2. Buried Booking Buttons

If a user has to click more than once to find your "Book Now" button, you have already lost 20% of your potential revenue.

Your booking engine (Hoseasons, Pitchup, or direct) should be accessible from **every single pixel** of your site. It should follow the user down the page.

> **Pro Tip:** Check your analytics. If your "Book Now" button isn't the most clicked element on your homepage, your design is broken.

## 3. Zero Social Proof

You say you're great. Of course you do. But trust is at an all-time low.
Visitors trust **other guests** 10x more than they trust you.

If you don't have a verified reviews widget (TripAdvisor, Google, or a custom feed) visible on your first screen, you are asking the guest to take a blind risk.

## The Fix: Conversion Engineering

We don't just "build websites." We build **Direct Booking Systems**.
1.  **Sticky CTAs** that follow the scroll.
2.  **Social Proof** integrated into the hero section.
3.  **Fast Load Times** (under 2s) so mobile users don't bounce.

Is your website an asset or an expense? If it's not generating daily direct bookings, it's an expense. Let's fix that.
