The biggest lie in hospitality is that "personal service" means "doing everything manually."

In 2026, guests expect instant answers. If they email you about dog-friendly units and you take 4 hours to reply, they have already booked with the park down the road that has an AI chatbot.

## The 4-Step Automation Flow

Here is the exact stack we implement for our clients to save 10+ hours a week per staff member.

### 1. The Pre-Booking Nurture
When someone downloads a guide or abandons a booking, do you follow up?
*   **Manual Way:** You don't.
*   **Automated Way:** An email sequence triggers: *"Saw you looking at the Luxury Lodge. Here's a 5% discount code valid for 24 hours."*

### 2. The Operations Message (WhatsApp)
7 days before arrival, your system should automatically WhatsApp the guest:
*"Hey Sarah, looking forward to welcoming you next week! Would you like to upgrade to a hamper for £30?"*

This isn't just service; it's **upselling on autopilot**.

### 3. The Digital Compendium
Stop printing paper welcome packs. They are outdated the moment you print them.
Send a link to a digital app/page with WiFi codes, local restaurants, and heating instructions.

### 4. The Review Chase
The moment they check out?
Trigger an email: *"Hope you got home safe! Click here to leave a 5-star review."*

## Efficiency = Profit

Automation isn't about firing staff. It's about freeing them up to actually talk to guests who are *on-site*, rather than answering the same email about check-in times 50 times a day.
