## The Challenge

Luxury lodge enquiries were inconsistent, and the sales team needed better-qualified buyers. The club needed a system to deliver high-intent prospects, not just "tyre-kickers."

## Our Solution

We implemented a targeted lead generation system focused on quality over quantity.

*   **Qualified Lodge Enquiries:** High-intent buyers, not browsers.
*   **Sales Team Support:** Focused conversations, less wasted time.
*   **Year-Round Demand:** Consistent interest beyond peak periods.

## Outcomes

The sales team now has a consistent pipeline of qualified leads, allowing them to focus on closing sales rather than chasing cold prospects.
