## The Challenge

Whalesborough Luxury Resort & Spa is a large, multi-offer destination — holiday cottages, luxury lodges for sale, a café, spa and gym, family farm experiences, events, and now a hotel.

Managing marketing across so many moving parts required more than isolated campaigns. The team needed a partner who could give the site consistent attention, respond quickly, coordinate everything end-to-end, and support both bookings and sales across the entire resort.

## Our Role

We act as Whalesborough's embedded marketing team, working closely with the directors and on-site staff week in, week out.

Our role spans the full picture — from driving enquiries and bookings, to launching new offerings and supporting high-value lodge sales. We manage and coordinate:

*   **All resort websites**
*   **Meta & Google advertising**
*   **Multiple Social Media Accounts**
*   **Enquiry handling and lead follow-up**
*   **Email setup and ongoing communications**
*   **Print materials and on-site promotion**
*   **Weekly planning and strategy meetings**
*   **Campaigns for events, café promotions, family farm days, and seasonal peaks**
*   **Marketing support for luxury lodge sales (including appointments and follow-up)**

We're regularly on site, always available at the end of the phone, and closely integrated with the internal team — ensuring nothing falls through the cracks.

## Outcomes

*   **29% year-on-year growth** across the holiday cottage rental fleet.
*   **£1.4 million in sales** supported across the wider resort.
*   Successful launch and promotion of **The Arvor Suites** hotel.
*   Consistent booking demand across cafés, events, family farm days, and leisure facilities.
*   A joined-up marketing system that supports both short-term bookings and long-term asset sales.

Rather than chasing one-off wins, everything is built to compound.
